<p>ðŸ‘‹&nbsp;Hi, I&rsquo;m Terrence Lawrence. I am a Software Engineer with over 20 years of software design and development experience in support of complex distributed real-time sensor architectures, high performance computing (HPC) using multi-core CPU and multi-GPU environments, real-time data acquisition, real-time embedded systems, data visualization applications, digital signal processing, digital image processing, machine learning, graphical user interfaces, data communications software. I support business development efforts, and customer briefs in a research and development environment. I have extensive knowledge and experience with object-oriented programming languages, design patterns, and object-oriented frameworks. In addition, I have experience using software design tools, I am able to apply object-oriented analysis, and design (OOAD) principles. I have experience with various software configuration management systems, and I am able to execute best practices in support of software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p>
<p>ðŸ‘€&nbsp;<strong>Specialties:</strong></p>
<p>Complex distributed real-time sensor architectures, high performance computing (HPC) using multi-core CPU and multi-GPU environments, real-time data acquisition, embedded SoC/SoM/DSP/GPU/SBC/MCU system software in C/C++, Linux device drivers, communication interfaces(e.g.TCP, UDP, CORBA, ACE/TAO, RTI Network DDS, ARINC 429, Google Protocol Buffers, message queues, shared memory), multi-threaded applications, scripting languages(e.g. Octave, Matlab, Python), Subversion (SVN), and Git</p>
<p>ðŸŽ†&nbsp;The purpose of this repository is to provide a sandbox to explore and collaborate with concepts in machine learning, signal processsing, image processing, embedded systems, and sensors.</p>
