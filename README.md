ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Terrence Lawrence. I am a Software Engineer with over 20 years of software design and development 
experience in support of complex distributed real-time sensor architectures, high performance computing (HPC) using 
multi-core CPU and multi-GPU environments, real-time data acquisition, real-time embedded systems, data visualization 
applications, digital signal processing, digital image processing, machine learning, graphical user interfaces,
data communications software. I support business development efforts, and customer briefs in a research and development 
environment. I have extensive knowledge and experience with object-oriented programming languages, design patterns, 
and object-oriented frameworks. In addition, I have experience using software design tools, I am able to apply 
object-oriented analysis, and design (OOAD) principles. I have experience with various software configuration management systems, 
and I am able to execute best practices in support of software development lifecycle (SDLC).

ðŸ‘€ Specialties: Complex distributed real-time sensor architectures, high performance computing (HPC) using multi-core CPU and multi-GPU 
environments, real-time data acquisition, embedded SoC/SoM/DSP/GPU/SBC/MCU system software in C/C++, Linux device drivers, 
communication interfaces(e.g.TCP, UDP, CORBA, ACE/TAO, RTI Network DDS, ARINC 429, Google Protocol Buffers, message queues, 
shared memory), multi-threaded applications, scripting languages(e.g. Octave, Matlab, Python), Subversion (SVN), and Git

ðŸŽ† The purpose of this repository is to provide a sandbox to explore and collaborate with concepts in machine learning,
signal processs, image processing, embedded systems, and sensors.

Projects:

Sonar Mine Classification
